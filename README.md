# Gym Management System using SQL, NoSQL, and Python

• Designed Schema diagramsfor the Gym Management System, converting them into relational models, and implemented both SQL and NoSQL
(MongoDB) databases, defining 12 tables, establishing key relationships, constraints, and inserting 300+ records across all tables.

• Engineered a Python application that interfaces with databases, retrieves records, and visualizes data to communicate meaningful insights.

• Developed advanced SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and aggregations, alongside CTEs, to extract valuable insights from the data.
